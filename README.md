# NewsApp - Top Headlines & Latest News

This project is a **React** web application that displays top news headlines across various categories, including Home, General, Business, Entertainment, Health, Science, Sports, and Technology. The project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ðŸ“‹ Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make changes to the code.  
Check the console for any lint errors.

### `npm test`

Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build output is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app will be ready for deployment!

### `npm run eject`
